1,BetPuzzleheaded4080,bipolar disorder,Yesterday  I complained about feeling manic over that weekend  racing thoughts  wanting to move while not wanting to  a lot of ideas  too much energy with no where to go  Not sleeping too much and feeling restless/tired  This was after me taking meds for 5 days  Today  I didn t sleep too much like 5  but I usually sleep up to 8 9 to feel refreshed  So  I felt tired  but extra tired because I felt like I spent mental energy  I felt worn out all throughout work  Kinda spacing out at times  But  once I reached my house  I felt fine  I feel tired  but fine  Not too hyper at all  if anything maybe a little low  But  not enough where I even wanna complain  So  idk  Is it all just in my head,135,Yesterday
2,bipolarquickquestion,bipolar disorder,Hi all I'm diagnosed bipolar  don't know the type  following a cannabis induced episode of mania  amp  x200B When I was younger  up to maybe my twenties   life was very pleasurable for me  Especially music and everyday scenes/moods  empty streets and sunshine in the summer  watching landscapes while driving and listening to music  the first days of summer     I would listen to so much different music a lot of the time everyday and got great pleasure from it  would listen to songs again and again without loss of interest or pleasure  amp  x200B Through the years  my feelings of pleasure have diminished greatly  I very rarely feel the desire to listen to music and get a lot less pleasure from it  and even feel some sort of a negative feeling about most of the music I used to listen to  I don't get the pleasurable aesthetic feelings from every day life and scenes that I used to  either  if you know what I'm talking about    I also lost the desire to play video games  used to play and enjoy them a lot when younger   I generally also feel a lack of strong emotions  motivation  appreciation of beauty in nature or art  I've had two anguished/depressive episodes  one at 20 yo  the other at 27  I'm 33 now  I cannot tell if these episodes were the cause  or partial cause  of that loss of pleasure and passion  amp  x200B I would love to know if anyone can relate to my experience  If so  did you ever find anything that gave you back more feelings  emotions and pleasure   amp  x200B For me cannabis did that  subtly at first when I was smoking once in a while and then I went into a manic episode and I found my love of music again  maybe even stronger  Obviously  this isn't a reasonable solution  especially as this manic phase has been followed by a pretty severe depression that I am still currently suffering from  after 5 months of treatment  Does anyone else have flattened emotions and pleasure even outside of mood episodes,347,Hi
3,Numerous_Ad_6237,bipolar disorder,If someone with bipolar were to smoke weed on a regular basis would that cause more manic episodes  every time I stop smoking I feel like I m going insane not like withdrawals I ll just feel like I m slowly getting more and more insane but when I smoke I m never manic  Follow up on that question if someone with bipolar where to take psychedelics more than the average person would that cause problems in the future  Hypothetical Question,81,If
4,SnooDoughnuts8919,bipolar disorder,I've had these side effects on and off for the last 1 5 yrs and I've narrowed it down to decreasing lithium dose or occasional benadryl for sleep  I've taken benadryl for sleep off and on for about 10 years and used to take every night for   5 yrs before that with  no problems  Only other change is reducing lithium dose from 900 to 600/300 alternating  I occasionally forget to take it altogether  I haven't started to pay attention to how this correlates with timing of these awful episodes but I am going to start   Anyway  I feel extreme anxiety like nothing ever before  dysphoria  suicidal thoughts  paranoia  and weird general processing of my environment  everything looks dark and bleak and hopeless  I can't find any value in the world  Strangely it feels like it would if there were not many people left in the world and i wake up one day and my husband and son are gone  and my dog  and I live in this house alone  bleak  rundown  just way worse than Ive ever felt  I hope it's the lithium because I could do something about it  Until now it has just started without warning and lasts for days to a week   maybe the amount of time I am taking reduced doses of Lithium        Anyone else  reducing lithium extreme anxiety panic dysphoria,225,I've

7,aBirdwithNoName,bipolar disorder,i was trying to explain my sense of alienation to my therapist and came into a weird damn extended metaphor for it  maybe it'll help someone else in here feel a little less alienated as well so here's the thought we all need to drink to survive  some of us are raised drinking clean  nice water  some of us are raised drinking dish soap i hear you  dish soap is bad  you shouldn't be drinking it  but some of us really have no choice in the matter  we're born and our parents immediately begin mixing dish soap into our drinks  maybe we find some friends who let us have a taste of clear water and they help us realize that dish soap isn't how all water tastes  or maybe our grandparents give us a safe place away from drinking dish soap  maybe it's that our parents were raised drinking dish soap  too  and they were told it's just the way things are supposed to be  in any case  we're raised drinking dish soap this is a metaphor about suffering  by the way i was raised drinking dish soap from a very young age  my bipolar onset was likely due to a concussion i got when i was 2  distinct manic episodes were occurring by early grade school  complete with psychotic elements  i was told by my family that my experiences were normal  and dismissed again and again  taught that my emotions were the same as everyone else's  that my psychotic delusions were just my overactive imagination  that my mania was just me having a bad control over my temper  and so on and so forth  but we weren't talking about that  we're talking about drinking dish soap  that's what i mean when i mean dish soap  i have suffered illness from a very young age  and this is the soap  i know i just said the dish soap is suffering  it's also the suffering from the disorder  got it now  not all glasses of dish soap are the same  sometimes  the dish soap has water in it  sometimes the water is a higher percentage than the dish soap  sometimes worse  when things are at their worst  i'm drinking pure  undiluted dish soap  when they're at their best  i'd say maybe it's about 20  dish soap  80  water  so i've experienced some pretty low doses of dish soap at times  as i've gotten older  i've found more people to pour water into my glass and displace the dish soap  so it's a smaller and smaller percentage over the years  these people are my lover  my friends  the people who have supported me and made my life easier  they understand that i drink dish soap  and that they can't just give me a new glass  this is the only glass i'll ever had  but they can pour good things in and it'll force the dish soap out my friends and loved ones understand what i mean when they see me drinking dish soap  but not always  and not everyone understands  and this is where the alienation comes in  and why this is a metaphor  because it helped me explain a complicated issue not everyone views my cup of dish soap the same way i was raised drinking pure  undiluted dish soap  so when my friends and loved ones pour water in  and i'm only drinking 20  dish soap  it's the clearest  most refreshing glass of water that i've ever tasted  i feel relieved and happy to be drinking 80  water  if i'm drinking pure dish soap  i hate it  and i might reach out to people for help and get some water in there  if i'm drinking 50  dish soap  it may be unpleasant but maybe to me  it's still acceptable  i tolerate it  my happiest is when i'm drinking 20  dish soap  to me  that's as good as it gets sometimes  i talk to somebody who's been raised drinking clear water  or has only ever had dish soap a few times in their life  i will be telling them about my 20  dish soap days with a smile on my face  telling them how happy i was to have 80  water to drink  they react with visceral disgust  hearing that i was drinking 20  dish soap  not seeing the water that i'm talking about  i keep telling people stories of my life thinking that they'll find them funny or enjoyable  and instead i find myself being pitied by people over things that i viewed as a positive  the days that i thought were my happiest  my best  to people who have never had dish soap  20  seems like a fate worse than death my partner drinks dish soap too  it's true  he suffers from unipolar depression and has been given a fair amount of dish soap in his life  but it must not taste the same as the dish soap i'm drinking  because even though i know he's never had clean water either  he still reacts with shock and pity sometimes when i tell him about what i'm drinking  i try to tell him something about my life and he reacts with surprise  hurt and upset for me that i've suffered so much  but i was telling him about a day where i had 75  water and it was actually a pretty good day  he nervously pours more of his own water into my cup  draining it from himself because he's worried about all the dish soap i've been drinking  and he wants to help  i love him to bits  but sometimes even he doesn't understand if i'm telling him a happy story  because he's so busy seeing the ways that i've suffered  sometimes  i tell people i'm drinking dish soap and they tell me i'm lying  that it's just water  nobody could actually survive drinking dish soap for so long  i'd be dead and in hell by now if i was really drinking dish soap  they don't believe me about the extent of my illness  they tell me that if i was really that bad  i'd have committed suicide already or been permanently institutionalized  they don't understand that lobsters can sit in the water until they boil sometimes  i tell people about the 80  water days and they pity me so deeply  it becomes difficult to talk about anymore  my best days  my happiest moments  get sullied by the way that people react to them with horror  they never grew up drinking dish soap  and think that any dish soap at all is a fate worse than death and at the end of it all  it's not about dish soap  it's about alienation about the times that i've told people stories about my life and they were so wrapped up in pity about how pathetic and sad my life must be living with bipolar disorder  that they don't see my joy  they don't see that i'm a person who can experience happiness on good days i went to graduate school in another state  years ago  the program was the first time i'd lived that far away from my abusive family  and it exposed me to so many new views  new experiences  new people  i learned that my new favorite food was the buttercream cupcakes i got at the market near my apartment  and that i liked to listen to music and dance while i was cooking  i discovered that i enjoyed my own company  and that i enjoyed the company of others as long as they were people i could trust  i got to experience so many things that i never would have experienced otherwise ultimately  after 1 semester  i was removed from the program for being transgender  a few months later  i had to move back home  back into the abuse  because i could not afford to stay out there without student loans to help support my housing  to this day  i still consider those months that i spent in another state as the best time of my life  but when i tell people about it  they only hear about how i was removed from grad school for being trans  they don't hear about the trans woman i met in a bookstore who was the first other trans person i'd met who was actually older than me  and gave me hope there was a future for me  they don't hear about the fact i got to hold famous books from the 1500s and that it permanently inspired the way that i approach my art  vesalius is super cool if you've never seen the art   they don't hear that i took a class that taught me how to make paper  and that i learned that my passion in life is to make zines and booklets and share art and creativity with other people  they don't hear about the stuff that i loved  that made my life better when i tell people about it  they hear only the bad  and they input their own opinions onto my experience  and tell me that it was horrible  they pity me  tell me i never should've had to experience it  that i should've been able to just stay home and never gone to grad school in the first place and i don't disagree that things shouldn't have ended that way  unfortunately that's not a state where it's illegal to bar someone from a school program for being transgender  i moved back to chicago where i'm in a protected minority class  and i don't intend to leave the state again  but when i was out there    there was no recourse for what happened to me  and i do have my anger and frustration about it  of course  but i also overwhelmingly still see that period of my life as a positive but when i tell people  they only see the negative they only see the dish soap  and they don't see the water  i think  for a bit  i only had 10  dish soap  and i really felt that someday i'd have my first taste of clear water  it gave me hope  it gave me joy  and everyone else just sees dish soap  they pity me so much for the dish soap that they make me feel strange talking about my happiest days  as though my joy was not and should not have been real  i slowly get quieter and withdraw because nobody can understand how happy i was drinking 90  water  when they only see that i was drinking 10  dish soap  it was the best time in my life and maybe people treat you the same way  they shut you down when you talk about your happiness  because it's not the right kind of happiness for you  they pity you  they see you as your suffering before they see you as a person  it's deeply fucking alienating but you're not the only one drinking dish soap  and you aren't alone so for everyone out there whose best days still look sad and pitiable to everyone else  you aren't alone  you're not the only one drinking dish soap out there  and i understand how wonderful those days are when the cup is 80  water  alienation and dish soap,1874,i

16,MatMat_0,depression,Another post almost nobody will read This is my last attempt to get better  As I said in my last post I'm just done with everything   You don't gotta read it but basically I've tried everything but nothings really worked I'm 99  sure my depression is because of my obsession with a girl  If I can beat this obsession I think I can beat my depression as well  I think about her all the time  pretty much all my actions are influenced by her  and it just feels like my life and thoughts are just all about her I need to know how to stop an obsession  I'm currently friends with the girl tho and I have no intention of leaving her  I'm pretty much her only friend at school and I'm not abandoning her  So I know everyone is gonna say to just stop talking to her  but if that's the case don't bother  I'm sorry but I'm not doing that If this doesn't work I'll probably try medication  But I already know that won't work either  This will probably be one of my last posts on here  If none of this works I'm ending it  I might post if I do end up beating this  or at least make a little progress  But I don't think I'm capable of being helped  so as I said before this will probably be my last post  If you read this far  thanks for caring even the slightest bit my final attempt,250,Another

19,MountainGerman,depression,For context  I'm legally blind  hard of hearing  and on the spectrum  I live off of disability  I originally posted this on another subreddit but just discovered this one and I hope that someone might be able to offer some insight or advice  Or support  I'm just so tired right now  Being on disability has been a blessing and a curse for me  It's been a blessing because I now have a means by which to support myself and my daughter  I was born disabled  but didn't actually get on disability until adulthood and didn't work enough to get SSDI  so I rely solely on SSI and make the money stretch as much as I can by living with my parents   But it has also been a curse  because as I'm sure you all know  being disabled doesn't come with much money or resources  on top of the inherent restrictions one has due to their respective disabilities I spend the vast majority of my time alone  My parents both work  and my daughter is in school  I do have a couple of friends that I see on occasion  one on a weekly basis  So I have more time than I know what to do with  But having all this time alone has been a recipe for disaster for me  I'm extremely depressed and socially isolated  When I try to do things that I love  like reading  I love learning and studying various histories  or writing  creative outlet   I just can't seem to escape this horrible feeling that it's all pointless  Like  sure  I can read about the Thirty Years' War or get lost in books about my Faith  Eastern Orthodox  or other subjects I love  likelearninglanguages  too   but since I have no way to put my knowledge/hobbies to use  it all feels like just a sad waste of effort that will never amount to anything  I would love to be able to be involved with my hobbies/interests and share them with others  but I just can't think of how that could be done  Some of my interests are incredibly niche/specific  and the area I live in is fairly rural and not exactly full of diverse opportunities  I'd love to take classes  but have no idea where to begin on that as student loans are out of the question  And while I wouldn t be opposed to online courses  I once again run into the problem of not being able to use/share myself/my knowledge  as well as not knowing where to begin in searching for an online course or tutor  I want so desperately to be able to grow and thrive in my interests  but financial and transportation limitations on top of everything else just throttles my passion  and I don't know what to do anymore  Is anyone here aware of online courses/tutors/groups that could help me  Can anyone relate to this  I'm so tired of being stagnant  People have told me how jealous they are of how much time I have available to myself and that makes me feel even worse  because not only did I not ask to be disabled  but it makes me feel like I'm somehow being disabled the  wrong  way because they seem to know exactly what they would do to enjoy the endless time  I would love nothing more than to enjoy it I would love nothing more than to be useful  It's just really hard and I can't figure out what to do or where to go  Any and all advice would be wonderful  even if just to say that you relate and I'm not alone with these feelings/thoughts  Unlimited time  but no direction  Advice/Support appreciated/needed,612,For
20,Square_Ad4463,OCD,I was just recently diagnosed with OCD  One of my themes is fearing being perceived as racist and/or being shunned by others because they perceive me as problematic  My obsession has largely been about accidentally doing something racist until recently  when I remembered something racist I did when I was 14 or 15  I tweeted a joke that had the n word in it  I was not using the word in a hateful way  but basically as a replacement for the word  guy  in the joke  Still  I am white  and it's such a hateful  violent word when used by someone who is white  I got called out immediately by some acquaintances of mine who were black and I deleted it almost as soon as I posted it  It was the only time I've said the word  and I've never said it since  but I still obsess about that moment  I feel so guilty  like I should avoid being around POC to avoid accidentally subjecting them to racism  I look at other white people and feel like they probably haven't done things as bad as this  so they deserve to be happy  and I don't  It must be so horrible to grow up around white people as a black person and hear them test out using a slur like that around you  and I feel so ashamed to have participated in that  Selfishly  too  I obsess about being rejected by others because of it  Even though no one has ever brought this event up to me  I worry about it being  exposed   or I wonder if someone took a screenshot of my tweet  I have this feeling that eventually I will be found out and my relationships/career/life will be torpedoed  I know that this is just my OCD talking  and the reality is that if it ever came up  some people would criticize me  which they would have a right to  and others wouldn't and eventually we would all move on  Can I get some advice on what to do and how to feel better  Nothing seems to relieve my guilt  Real event OCD and racism,356,I
21,jaypawwww,OCD,Hey all  I have been struggling with OCD and on and off themes since I was 8  This year in particular has been terrible  as I have been jumping from theme to theme since February  The longest break I d gotten was probably about a few weeks before another theme started I just recently recovered from a particularly bad theme and I was doing great for like 2 weeks  However  last night I started fearing that I had BPD  I looked at the diagnostic criteria and I feel like I  could  just barely make it into a diagnosis  My biggest concern  and the theme that the OCD is focusing on right now  is the  lack of identity   I don t think that I have a lack of identity  i feel extremely in touch with my personality  my humor  my values  my appearance etc  However  when it comes to hobbies  I feel like there is where I could apply that BPD symptom  I used to have my own hobbies as a child  and I was a loner with no friends and I was happy about it  As I became a teen  I started befriending new people and I realized how far behind I was  I knew nothing about pop culture  or anything that my peers were into  I mostly loved fictional books and legos and science  From there  I started a terrible habit  I practically force myself into interests to fit in with a particular group  It s always the same group but I have so much distress and anxiety surrounding it  The worst part is that I actually think these hobbies and interests are cool and fun  but because I have so much anxiety surrounding them  I just feel anxiety and dread when participating in them  I feel like a fraud  like my whole identity is fake  But by identity  i mostly just mean hobbies  Not my actual self and personality  that s always remained purely me  I also have severe anxious attachment  and when I get attached to one person  currently my significant other   I become practically obsessed and terrified of them leaving  so i try to force myself into their interests  But I genuinely come to like these interests  not all of course  and I never force myself into something I just hate   except when I feel so much dread about starting it because it  doesn t feel right   I can t start a new show until it feels like the  right  moment and it s weighing on me so much because it carries into every aspect of my life  including homework  gaming  cleaning  fitness  everything  This is currently making me panic because I am terrified that I have BPD  What s freaking me out at the moment is the prospect that my whole identity is fake and that one day I will crumble and lose myself and not know what to do  I m so scared  I just need a bit of support right now please  Weird new theme that I am trying to deter before it truly settles in,513,Hey
22,cailinob18,OCD,I m OCD and have emetophobia  sp    I have had TONS of obsessions over the years  but chief among them has always been gross things/ pathogens/poisons getting into my environment and body  As a result  I m petrified of roaches  When I find one inside the house  I basically turn into a zombie for several hours after  I can t function   My OCD was doing really well  I m even weening off Paxil  down to 10 mgs    But then we moved into a new house about a month ago and guess what it had waiting for me   A roach infestation   12 sightings this week alone  They come out to terrorize me at night  so I barely sleep  One ran across my feet in the bathroom a while ago  so I ve stopped being comfortable in there and as such haven t been showering or tending to my hygiene like I usually would  I m usually a skincare  teeth whitening  shower every day and moisturize girly   now I m lucky if I brush my teeth and wash my face   Probably the worst is that I am finding it VERY hard to eat in the house  I m just too grossed out and anxious  This is bad  because my OCD has been contributing to a lot of disordered eating and food restricting in recent years  I was finally getting that under control before this  Even worse  we re renting  So we have to ask my landlord to send out pest control  fill in cracks in the walls where roaches are probably coming from  etc  it s sending me into actual tantrums that I have to be on his slow  lazy timeline when I literally feel like I m going crazy in his house  Last time it took him a week to send out pest control  I ve even talked to my husband about breaking the lease and just leaving  Any support appreciated  I just feel so down  tired and disgusted  I want a place to feel comfortable in again  r/ocd Roaches in my new house have triggered my OCD badly and now I can barely eat or sleep here,357,I
23,Separate_Tangelo7138,OCD,I have to plan to leave ahead of time because it takes me an extra 10  minutes to check that I haven t left candles  coffee maker  oven  etc on several times before I leave  I have a terrible fear of my house catching fire when I leave  This obsessive fear was intensified 100000 fold after I caused an accidental fire in my yard   Nobody got hurt  but it was terrifying Even if I know I haven t lit a candle that day I think  Did I light one and forget   And check all the candles often more than once  Sometimes I finally get out the door and I feel like there s something I forgot to check  go back up and check again  Once I get in the car or to my destination I m obsessing in my head like  did I turn ___ off  Did I turn ___ off   imagining my house on fire and what not MAN is it exhausting  Often times I avoid using the oven or candles or anything when my boyfriend isn t home just to avoid the stress  Does anyone else take forever to leave the house because of checking things,198,I

25,SweetKanara,OCD,I ve known for a while I suffer from anxiety but I worry that this might have developed  or stemmed from perhaps  OCD  Since I was conscious  I always had a obsession with hand washing which has only gotten worse resulting in me having to frequently moisturise otherwise my hands suffer from severe pain  blisters  sensitivity etc  I ve also always struggled with toilet hygiene  I used to be scared of going to the toilet due to contamination which nowadays manifests in severe worries about things like bleeding  urine colour and more  Furthermore  I ve always been worried about sexual health  I thoroughly clean and the slightest bump sends me into a panic  There s a laundry lists of other examples but these are just some  I m not an expert  I did some research but couldn t find anything conclusive  Should I look at getting tested or something  Maybe see a psychologist  Thank you in advance    Started to consider I might have OCD but I m not sure,169,I
