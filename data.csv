0,twistedturtle,bipolar disorder,7 5 mg Mirtazapine for Sleep Experiences  please I've been hypomanic for a few months and I just tapered off escitalopram  took the last 5 mg this morning   My risperidone was increased  and I was put on zopiclone  I stopped taking the zopiclone last week  because I had a sleep walking experience I only heard about second hand and that freaked me out  I'm still not really sleeping much and still pretty hypo  so my doctor just put me on 7 5 mg of mirtazapine to try to help with sleep  with the reasoning that there is a study showing low doses of trazadone and mirtazapine are safe for people with bipolar disorderI'm afraid of staying hypo or even getting worse and I'm hoping to hear the experiences of those of you who take the same dose for sleep  I get anxious about any new medication  Mirtazapine for sleep  experiences,150,7

2,BetPuzzleheaded4080,bipolar disorder,Yesterday  I complained about feeling manic over that weekend  racing thoughts  wanting to move while not wanting to  a lot of ideas  too much energy with no where to go  Not sleeping too much and feeling restless/tired  This was after me taking meds for 5 days  Today  I didn t sleep too much like 5  but I usually sleep up to 8 9 to feel refreshed  So  I felt tired  but extra tired because I felt like I spent mental energy  I felt worn out all throughout work  Kinda spacing out at times  But  once I reached my house  I felt fine  I feel tired  but fine  Not too hyper at all  if anything maybe a little low  But  not enough where I even wanna complain  So  idk  Is it all just in my head,135,Yesterday
3,Numerous_Ad_6237,bipolar disorder,If someone with bipolar were to smoke weed on a regular basis would that cause more manic episodes  every time I stop smoking I feel like I m going insane not like withdrawals I ll just feel like I m slowly getting more and more insane but when I smoke I m never manic  Follow up on that question if someone with bipolar where to take psychedelics more than the average person would that cause problems in the future  Hypothetical Question,81,If
