Master's thesis

Predicting the mental state of a person based on social media messages.

The newdata.zip represents the data that are being fetched from Reddit. That part of the code is commented out since the data is already fetched. It contains 3 columns: "author", "disorder" and "text".
The fetched data got submissions from 4 different subreddits, each for different mental health state:
  - bipolar disorder
  - depression
  - ocd
  - schizophrenia

The "disorder" column contains these values/labels. Besides these values, normal state data are also being fetched and labeled as "test"

The SuicideDetection.zip represents the data fetched from the Kaggle website. It contains 2 columns: "text" and "class". The "class" column contains 2 lables:
  - suicide
  - non-suicide

The chart below shows all the step neccesary for completing the thesis.
